Original authors have uploaded their code here https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels


# Introduction
A Collection of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for EEG signal processing and classification, written in PyTorch. 

- The original paper authors only support TensorFlow and Keras versions.
- There is no open-source EEG model available that supports Python version 3 and above.
- Therefore, I aim to share PyTorch code that supports Python version 3 and above, specifically for EEG researchers.🧠🔍

The aim of this repository is to (like original authors,)
- provide a set of well-validated CNN models for EEG signal processing and classification
- facilitate reproducible research and
- enable other researchers to use and compare these models as easy as possible on their data
